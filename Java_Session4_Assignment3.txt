2.Assume that class A extends class B, which extends class C. 
Also all the three classes implement the method test(). 
How can a method in a class A invoke the test() method defined in class C ?
(without creating a new instance of class C).

Result :
It is not possible to invoke test() method defined in C from a method in A.

a.) super.test(); - can be used to invoke B from C
    super.test(); - again to invoke A from B --> This is how A can be invoked from C.

b.) super.super.test(); - Java intentionally prohibits this as it violates encapsulation.
